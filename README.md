ðŸ“˜ SAP-4000 Dataset: Investigating Determinants of Academic Success in Spainâ€™s TÃ­tulo de Bachiller
The SAP-4000 dataset encompasses 4,000 anonymized student records, meticulously compiled to analyze the multifaceted factors influencing academic performance in Spainâ€™s upper secondary education system, culminating in the TÃ­tulo de Bachiller. This qualification is pivotal, as it not only signifies the completion of secondary education but also serves as a prerequisite for university admission via the EvaluaciÃ³n de Bachillerato para el Acceso a la Universidad (EBAU).

Recognizing the complexity of academic achievement, the dataset integrates a diverse array of variables, including demographic information, study habits, educational support mechanisms, and final examination outcomes. This comprehensive approach facilitates a nuanced exploration of how these factors interact and contribute to student success.
